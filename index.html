                My dream is to be an innovative engineer and I see opportunities
                everywhere. I like to accomplish new things by learning and solving
                challenges as they emerge in different projects. I am an attentive
                person who likes to get down to the nitty-gritty of things and be
                up-to-date with technological development. I had ample time to spare
                during Covid so I decided to improve my programming skills. I enjoyed
                working on personal projects and collaborating with people from
                programming communities. I try to attend Tech meetups whenever I can.
                <br>
                At the moment, I am looking to build up my professional career as a
                Software/Full-stack Developer.

            <h3>Personal Reflection</h3>
            <p>
                My life has always been an out-of-the-box journey. It is filled with
                lots of incredible learning experiences, skill development and
                continuous thinking. It was easy to get caught up in the day-to day
                aspects of student life and focus on learning while forgetting to
                pause, self-reflect, and look at the bigger picture to help me create
                a better sense of identity, who I want to be and how I will get there.
                <br>
                Similar to climbing a mountain, sometimes I can see the peak I want to
                reach. However, most of the time, I am hiking through trees along
                trails that don't seem to head anywhere. There are some aspects that
                have influenced my learning positively. Whereas, there were some
                opportunities that I dove into without knowing what to expect.
