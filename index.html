            <h2 id="about">About me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Adel Ansari! ðŸ‘‹</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Background: </b>Nuclear/Mechanical Engineering</li>
                <li><b>Career goal: </b>Full-stack software developer</li>
            </ul>
            <p>My dream is to be an innovative engineer and I see opportunities everywhere. I like to accomplish new
                things by learning and solving challenges as they emerge in different projects.
                I am an attentive person who likes to get down to the nitty-gritty of things and be up-to-date with
                technological development. I had ample time to spare during Covid so I decided to improve my programming
                skills. I enjoyed working on personal projects and collaborating with people from programming
                communities. I try to attend Tech meetups whenever I can. At the moment, I am looking to build up my
                professional career as a Software/Full-stack Developer.
            </p>
            <h3>Personal Reflection</h3>
            <p>My life has always been an out-of-the-box journey. It is filled with lots of incredible
                learning experiences, skill development and continuous thinking. It was easy to get caught up in the
                day-to day aspects of student life and focus on learning while forgetting to pause, self-reflect, and
                look at the bigger picture to help me create a better sense of identity, who I want to be and how I will
                get there. Similar to climbing a mountain, sometimes I can see the peak I want to reach. However, most
                of the time, I am hiking through trees along trails that donâ€™t seem to head anywhere. There are some
                aspects that have influenced my learning positively. Whereas, there were some opportunities that I dove
                into without knowing what to expect.
            </p>
